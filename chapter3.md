## What is an IPO?
> In it's full form IPO is Initial Public Offering. What is it though? An initial public offering or stock launch is a public offering in which shares of a company are sold to institutional investors and usually also to retail investors.

> https://upstox.com/learning-center/ipo/how-does-an-ipo-work/ this article explains IPOs' working and requirements.


## Can you apply for an IPO and if yes, how?
> Yes, you can apply for an IPO provided you are over the legal age limit, have a valid demat account, and obviously have money to apply. Then, you'll be provided
  a lot if you win a lucky draw.


## What is my advice on investing in IPOs? 
> RESEARCH. That's it. Understand what makes the company worth investing in. Does it have a long term prospect of being highly profitable or dominant in a market?
  Does it have an inevitable root hold on our system? Does it have an impact on thousands of people? Is the board good? Was the company's performances good? etc. are 
  some questions to tackle first.
